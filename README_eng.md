# 🗂 Task Manager 2.0

Version 2.0 is an advanced task manager project that connects a console application in Python with a REST API built in Flask, a MySQL database, and a React frontend. This project was created as part of building a QA tester portfolio.

---

## 🚀 Functionality

- CRUD operations on tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- REST API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- MySQL database: storing and managing tasks
- Both the console application and the Flask API use the same database
- React frontend: display tasks by status, change status, delete tasks
- Automated tests using `pytest` (refactored and console versions)
- Simple styles for better readability and usability

---

## ⚙️ Technologies

- Python 3.11
- Flask
- MySQL (local, automatic DB and table creation via console)
- Postman (API testing)
- Pytest (unit + mock tests)
- React
- Playwright (planned E2E frontend tests)
